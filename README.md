# codeacademy_biodiversity_project
The final project in the 'Data Science Foundations' course I completed on Codecademy. 
The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the USNational Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.
This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.
